It‚Äôs December. I‚Äôm in San Crist√≥bal de las Casas at a coffee shop and reflecting on my past twelve months of adventures. This annual review format is inspired by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/annual-review) and will answer these three questions:

- What went well this year?
- What didn‚Äôt go so well this year?
- What did I learn?

# 1. What went well this year?

In January I had my last day of work at [Tempest](https://jointempest.com/). I had followed [Holly Whitaker](https://www.hollywhitaker.com/) and her work for years and joining her company as a software engineer was my dream job. I was laid off along with the rest of the engineering team when the company decided to focus all resources on building a mobile app.

I decided to take a few months off which turned into a year sabbatical. This was the first time I ever took an extended break from work. After attending a [coding bootcamp](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) in 2018 I was hired as a teaching fellow and then worked remotely for two startups as a fullstack dev. I‚Äôve had a [scarcity mindset](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/scarcity-mindset) because of how I grew up so I wouldn't have voluntarily taken time off of work. It was unplanned but I‚Äôm grateful things unfolded the way they did.

I‚Äôm used to being an overachiever and having projects or goals to work towards. I didn‚Äôt create anything this year. I wrote very little code. My Github squares did not turn green. I didn‚Äôt accomplish anything professionally measurable, but that‚Äôs okay. I traveled to [eight countries](https://nomadlist.com/hollielu). I rested. I healed. I mentally recovered from the pandemic. I loved. I existed. I celebrated six years sober and entered a new decade of life when I turned thirty this summer in Thailand.

Taking time off of work allowed me to travel in a different way. I‚Äôve been a digital nomad for fifteen months and I worked while in Portugal, Spain and London. While I‚Äôm working I‚Äôll travel more slowly and spend 1-3 months in each country. I love working remotely but I definitely appreciated having an extra forty hours of my life back every week. This year I visited Argentina, Peru, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Thailand, Bali, Singapore, and Mexico. üó∫Ô∏è

I wrote 85 journal entries. I listened to 22,538 minutes of music on Spotify. I read [36 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/35403273). A few that made it onto my [#favorites](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/10490939?shelf=favorites) shelf:

- [Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7640261-sex-at-dawn)
  - Challenges conventional views on sex by diving deep into our ancestor‚Äôs sexual history, the rise of monogamy and delivering starting points for thinking over our understanding of what sex and relationships should look like.
- [White Feminism: From the Suffragettes to Influencers and Who They Leave Behind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54550125-white-feminism)
  - ‚ÄúInstead of a protest vehicle, feminism became a brand‚Ä¶ to ‚Äòrevolutionize‚Äô your life through business once again merges the radicalism of feminism with the corporate, women-oppressing language of capitalism. If you threw a millennial-pink lens over this saying, you could put it on Pinterest.‚Äù
- [Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain)
  - How to capture, remember, and benefit from the vast quantities of information around us by building a personal system for knowledge management.

I spent a month exploring Web3 and won a scholarship from [HerDAO](https://www.her-dao.xyz/) to attend [Token2049](https://www.token2049.com/) in Singapore. I participated in a hackathon for [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/) and built the frontend for a NFT directory of vertical farms. I learned about DeFi in [SheFi](https://www.shefi.org/). I attended [Sextech School](https://www.sextechschool.com/) and explored launching a business in sextech. I did the [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

I met up with friends around the world and made many new ones. I did [Wifi Tribe](https://wifitribe.co/) chapters in Buenos Aires and Bocas del Toro. I hiked up to a glacier in Argentina and out of the second deepest canyon in the world in Peru. I went on a date to Machu Picchu and fell in love in Thailand. I attended my first kink party in Bali. It was a magical year. üí´

# 2. What didn‚Äôt go so well this year?

I signed up for a [yoga teacher training](https://embodyyogasroots.com/) and discovered I do not enjoy learning yoga online. I can learn some things over Zoom but yoga is not one of them. I gave up halfway through. In the future I‚Äôll take an in-person training.

My productivity was at an all time low. I didn‚Äôt follow any kind of routine. I woke up late, I didn‚Äôt consistently exercise. I struggled to set boundaries in my romantic relationships. I [lost some money](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/technology/bitcoin-ether-price.html) on crypto. I quit coffee and drank coffee and quit coffee. I watched way too much reality television.

When I look back my perfectionist self thinks if I wasn‚Äôt working then I should have learned a new language, launched a business, coded a side project, or climbed a mountain. Maybe the real achievement was the [doing of nothing](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+do+nothing). It was my year of rest. My year of me. My twenties were a decade marked by addiction, trauma and feeling lost. This year I turned thirty. I‚Äôm confident, grounded, secure in who I am, and the happiest I‚Äôve ever been.

# 3. What did I learn?

The most important lesson I learned is I want to invest my energy back into myself next year. Over the past decade I've given so much to my romantic partners. I flew across the world for a fantasy of who I thought someone was. I chased the avoidant and convinced them to like me. I dated multiple people with mental health issues or addictions and tried to fix them. I was a therapist and a caretaker and a teacher and a coach instead of a partner.

Since I quit drinking I‚Äôve done so much self work. I now know myself really well but there‚Äôs always still more to discover. I don‚Äôt rely on external validation anymore. I can now recognize red flags and accept the reality of who people are instead of who I want them to be. I'm exploring [solo polyamory](https://www.mic.com/life/what-is-solo-polyamory). I'm no longer putting my partner's needs before my own - I am my own primary partner. I'm prioritizing my commitment to myself first.

This upcoming year my main goal is to write. I want to write code but also words for other humans to read, not just computers. I want to create more than I consume. I plan to keep nomading and staying in colivings. I love being in community and learning from others. I want to continue traveling South America so I can practice my Spanish and head towards Europe this summer. I will keep questioning societal norms and creating my own path. üíû
