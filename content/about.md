I'm Hollie (she/her/they/them). Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here I write about coding, relationships, being a digital nomad, and anything else that piques my interest. ‚ú®

I attended [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) in 2018. I've worked remotely as a fullstack dev for two mission-driven startups: one that helped teachers give feedback on student writing and one that empowered people to quit drinking. I've been in recovery from alcohol for six years. While I was living in Chicago I co-hosted social events for queer sober folx covered by the [Chicago Tribune](https://bit.ly/cqss-chicago-tribune) and [NBC](https://bit.ly/cqss-nbc).

I grew up in Hawaii and I was unschooled until high school. I graduated from the [University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/) with a degree in Human Sexuality. My thesis was on [femme invisibility](http://ashleighshackelford.com/writing/2017/1/28/queer-like-me-breaking-the-chains-of-femme-invisibility). I love learning and talking about alternative relationships, love, kink, intimacy and [sextech](https://www.newsweek.com/why-sex-tech-overlooked-giant-wellness-industry-1700747). I'm queer and currently exploring [solo polyamory](https://www.mic.com/life/what-is-solo-polyamory).

I've been a digital nomad for over a year and visited fifteen countries. You can currently find me in üá≤üáΩ.
