I'm Hollie, a fullstack software engineer. Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here I write about coding, relationships, being a digital nomad, and anything else that piques my interest. ✨

I attended [Fullstack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/) in 2018. I've worked remotely for two mission-driven startups: one that matched K-12 schools with teaching assistants for enhanced feedback on student writing and one that empowered people to quit drinking and build a life they love through a digital recovery program.

I've been a digital nomad for over a year and I've visited fifteen countries. I'm originally from Hawaii and I was unschooled until high school. Fun fact: I was in a circus as a child. I've been in recovery from alcohol for six years.

I graduated from the [University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/) with a degree in Human Sexuality. I love learning and talking about alternative relationships, love, kink, intimacy and [sextech](https://www.newsweek.com/why-sex-tech-overlooked-giant-wellness-industry-1700747). I'm queer and currently exploring solo polyamory.

I love to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/hollielu), write in my journal, and go hiking. I'm a Cancer and an [ENFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality).
